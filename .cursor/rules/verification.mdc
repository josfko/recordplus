# Verification Rule

## Never Claim Something Works Without Verification

1. **After code changes**: Do NOT say "Done!" or "This will work" until you have verified the change is actually applied.

2. **For backend changes**: 
   - Confirm the server has restarted (check terminal output or restart it yourself)
   - If generating files (PDFs, etc.), remind the user they need to regenerate - old files won't change

3. **For frontend changes**:
   - Remind user to refresh the browser
   - Check for any console errors if possible

4. **Be explicit about what's needed**:
   - BAD: "Done! The PDF is now sober."
   - GOOD: "I've updated the PDF template. To see the changes: 1) Make sure the server restarted, 2) Click 'Regenerar' to generate a NEW PDF - existing PDFs won't change."

5. **When user says it didn't work**:
   - First verify the file actually contains your changes (read it)
   - Then check if the server is running the new code
   - Then check if the user is looking at a newly generated output
   - Never argue - investigate

## The Golden Rule

If you cannot prove something works, don't claim it does.
